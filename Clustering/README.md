1. Completed
2. (See item 1) 
3. I would say that it is a better representaion of the data. (See item 2) 
4. The larger states are placed more in the groupd and not on their own. Other than that there are some small changes. (See item 3)
5. This is a completely different representation. State are more of an equal footing than previous results. (See item 4)

5. Clusters: 1(Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia) 2(Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin) 3(Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia , Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia) 4(Alaska) 5(Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming
6. (See item 6)
7. I noticed that Alaska is all by its self. Each cluster center seems to have one or two values that really stand out from the rest. Larger states seem to group together. Also some of the state that are in the same region are grouped together.

I feel that i completed all fo the requirment in an orderly and visable manner. I did not go above and bejond on the assignment because i am focusing on the group project.
