# CS-450

**Approach**

Overall there was a lot of work with drawing it all out on a white board and wrapping my head
around the ID3 algorithm.

**Challenges**

The most difficult part was organizing my data in a way that would work.

**Dataset**

Iris is a staple data set that has 4 columns of numeric data

**Results**

The tree was only 4 layers deep including the root and the first true side was a leaf.

**Above and Beyond**

As far as going above and beyond i created a second split function that split with frequency instead
of the range of the data. 

**Rating**

I would rate my work between 4-5.

**Jus
I took a lot of time to complete the assignment and learned a lot about trees. I did do some smaller 
steps to explore my tree with the second split function but ran out of time to really dive deep.
