## Please describe anything else you learned or did for this assignment (i.e., above and beyond requirements)
I really learned some of the various differences in each of the models. Some of them required some tweaking. Some of them are strait forward. Some of them do not preform well in some cases. And some are very well rounded.


## Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
* 1 - Some attempt was made
* 2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
* 3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
* 4 - Meets requirements
* 5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

I feel that I should receive a 5 because of the amount of time adn effort I put into the assignments and the extra models that I included.
